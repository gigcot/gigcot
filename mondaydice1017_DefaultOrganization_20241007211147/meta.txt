ChatEnvConfig.with_memory: False
ChatEnvConfig.clear_structure: True
ChatEnvConfig.git_management: False
ChatEnvConfig.gui_design: True

ChatEnvConfig.background_prompt: ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.


Roster:
Chief Executive Officer, Counselor, Chief Human Resource Officer, Chief Product Officer, Chief Technology Officer, Programmer, Code Reviewer, Software Test Engineer, Chief Creative Officer, Unit Test Specialist

Modality:
i agree that the application modality would be perfect for this task however, i think we should also consider creating an interactive dashboard to display the game's statistics and progress this way, users can easily track their wins, losses, and rolling history

my suggestion is to go with a hybrid approach: a core application with a dashbaord feature this would allow us to maintain the immersive experience while providing users with a convenient way to monitor their progress

your turn!
