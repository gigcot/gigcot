**1. Introduction**

LangChain is a library that enables developers to build applications by combining large language models (LLMs) with other sources of computation or knowledge. It provides a composable framework for creating powerful apps, such as question answering over specific documents and agents.

**2. Installation and Setup**

To get started with LangChain, follow these steps:

* Install the library using pip: `pip install langchain`
* Alternatively, use conda: `conda install langchain -c conda-forge`

Once installed, you can set up your environment by importing the necessary modules.

**3. Using LangChain**

### Quick Start Guide

Here's a basic example to get you started:

```python
from langchain import LLM

# Initialize an LLM instance
llm = LLM()

# Use the LLM to generate text
text = llm.generate_text("What is the capital of France?")

print(text)
```

### Example Use Cases

* **Question Answering over specific documents**: Use LangChain to combine an LLM with a document database, such as Notion.
* **Agents**: Create agents that can interact with users and respond accordingly.
