Modality:
application seems like a great fit for this roll dice app however, considering that it's a simple game, maybe we could also consider developing it as an image or dashboard to provide a more straightforward and real-time experience the customer might not need the full-fledged interactivity of an application, but rather a simple visual representation of the dice rolls

your turn!
